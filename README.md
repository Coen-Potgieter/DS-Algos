# DS-Algos

## Description

- This Repo contains my various implementations of different Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
- The following descriptions are taken from my notes and give a broad overview of how I implemented each DS

## Data Structures

### Dynamic Array

> - We have many ways of implementing a dynamic array
> - One way is to use static Arrays

#### Using Static Arrays

1. Create a Static Array with an initial size
2. Add Elements to the underlying static array keeping track of the number of elements
3. If Adding another element exceeds the initial capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity and copy the contents to this new static array
